#1)Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
#If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
#If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “c” as a string
#If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 its should print “Consultadd Python Training” as a string.

a = int(input("Enter value "))
if (a%3 == 0):
    print("Consultadd")      
if(a%5 == 0):
    print("C")
if(a%3 == 0 and a%5 == 0):
    print("Consultadd Python Training ")
      
#2)Ask the user to choose the following option first:
#If User Enter 1 - Addition 
#If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
#If User Enter 3 - Division
#If USer Enter 4 - Multiplication
#If User Enter 5 - Average

x = int(input("Enter 1st number to perform operation "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number to perform operation "))
a = int(input("User Enter to choose operation 1 to 5 "))
if (a <=4 ):
    if (a == 1):
        res = x + y  
        print res  
    if (a == 2):
        res = x - y
        print res
    if (a == 3):
        res = x * y
        print res
    if (a == 4):
        res = x / y
        print res
elif (a == 5):
        x5 = int(input("Enter 1st number to perform operation "))
        y5 = int(input("Enter 2nd number to perform operation "))
        res = (x5 + y5) / 2
        print res
if(res < 0):
    print("Zsa")
    
    
#3)Write a program in Python to implement the given flowchart:  
age = 38
if (age >= 11):
    print("You are eligible to see the football match")
    if (age <= 20 or age>= 60):
        print("Ticket price ia $12")
    else:
        print("Ticket price is $20")
else: 
    print("You are not eligible to buy a ticket.")


#4)Write a program in Python to break and continue

a = int(input("Enter number "))
while True:
    if(a < 0):
        print("It's Over")
        break
    elif(a > 0):
        print("Good Going")
        continue
        
#5)Write a program in Python which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200.
n = []
for i in range(2000, 3200):
    if(i % 7 == 0) and ((i % 5) != 0):
        n.append(str(i))
    print(','.join(n))
    
 #6)What is the output of the following code examples?
   x=123 
   	   for i in x:
   		print(i)
 Ans : Error
 Explanation: Objects of type int are not iterable.

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print(“error”)
ans:syntax error near unexpected token `“error”'

count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        Break
ans:
0
1
2
3
4
error: 'break' is not defined

#7)Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5 Note: Use the ‘continue’ statement
for a in range (6):
    if(a == 3 or a == 6):
        continue
    print(a, end=' ')
print("\n")

#8)Write a program that accepts a string as an input from the user and calculates the number of digits and letters.
a = input("Enter string with letters and digits ")
d = l = 0
for ch in a:
    if ch.isdigit():
        d = d + 1
    elif ch.isalpha():
        l = l +1
    else:
        pass
print("letters ", l) 
print("Digits", d)   

#9). Read the two parts of the question below: 
#Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”. If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever. 
#Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time. Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question of whether they want to continue guessing. The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”. ( The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed the correct number)
x = int(input("Guess the lucky number "))
y = 5
while True:    
    if (x == y):
        print("correct number")
        break
    else:
        print("incorrect number")
        continue 
       
       
#10)Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number.
counter = 1
while counter <=5:
    print("Type in the ",counter,"number")
    counter = counter+1
    x = int(input("Enter guess "))
    correct_num = 21
    if(x == correct_num):
        print("Good Guess!")
    else: 
        print("Try again!")
print("Game Over!")

#11) In the previous question, insert “break” after the “Good guess!” print statement. 
counter = 1
while counter <=5:
    print("Type in the ",counter,"number")
    counter = counter+1
    x = int(input("Enter guess "))
    correct_num = 21
    if(x == correct_num):
        print("Good Guess!")
        break
    else: 
        print("Try again!")
print("Sorry but that not very successful.")
