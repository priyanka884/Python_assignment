        x = int(input("Enter number "))
        if(len(x) == 4):
            print(x)
        elif(len(x) > 4):
            print("Unsuccessful try!")
        elif(len(x) < 4):
            print("Unsuccessful try!")

#4)Create a login page backend to ask user to enter the UserEmail and password. Make sure to ask Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it should not be more than 3 times.
count = 1
uname = input("Enter Username: ")
pword = input("Enter Password: ")
try: 
    if (uname == "patil1000" and pword == "abc123"):
        print("Login is Successful!!")
        break
    else:
        raise Exception
except:
    if(count<=3):
        print("Incorrect username or password, enter again ")
        count+=1
        continue
    else:
        print("No more Attempts")
        break
