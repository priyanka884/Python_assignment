#1)Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them 
a,b,c = 10,5.4,"study"
print (a,b,c)

#2)Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.
a,b=10,5+2j
a,b=b,a
print a

#3)Swap two numbers using the third variable as the result name and do the same task without using any third variable.
#program 1
a,b=10,20
c=a
a=b
b=c
print (a,b)

#program 2
a,b=11,22
a,b=b,a
print(a,b)

#4)Write a program to print the value given by the user by using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
var1 = input("user value ")
print (var1)


#5)Write a program to complete the task given
x=int(input("enter number any between 1 to 10 "))
y=int(input("enter number any between 1 to 10 "))
z=x+y+30
print (z)

#6)Write a program to check the data type
x = eval(input("Please enter any value: "))

#7)If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value. If Yes then Why?
#ans - yes. We can re-assign the value to any variable with any value of any data type. It will take re-assign value.
#e.g.
a=3
a='string'
print (a)
#ans -string
